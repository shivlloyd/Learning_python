"""
This code creates a lambda function, a small unnamed function, 
named `cube`. The function takes one parameter, `x`, 
and returns the cube of `x`, which is `x` raised to the power of 3. 

After defining this lambda function, the code immediately calls it 
with the argument `5` using `cube(5)`. As a result, it computes the 
cube of 5, which is `5` raised to the power of 3, equaling `125`. 
Therefore, when you execute `print(cube(5))`, it outputs `125`.
