"""
Here we defined a function named `add` that takes two parameters, 
`num_one` and `num_two`. Inside the function, 
it performs addition of these two parameters using the `+` operator and returns the result. 
Then, the function is called with arguments `5` and `10`, 
and the result of the addition is printed using the `print` statement.
